In Lassie, a 1950s television series, we knew that the Collie would come to the rescue. Collie is surely not only the star of the show but a star in real life as well. The real-life Collie is an extremely intelligent, sensitive dog known for her uncanny ability to know when something is wrong. True stories abound about this breed coming to the rescue of people and animals. They are definitely our super furry hero but aside from this, they are easy to train, devoted to and protective of her family, and friendly with people outside the family circle as well. She makes an excellent companion for children and an excellent watchdog for the whole family.",

Meanwhile, brushing once a week is sufficient for the Smooth Collie.\n\nIn terms of bathing, bathe as needed, usually every six to eight weeks. Brushing may be challenging because of their thick coat, but practice and instruction can keep this from becoming a discouraging chore. When trimming their nails, do it at least once a month. Do not forget to check their ears once a week for dirt, redness, or bad odor. Brush their teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and bacteria.",
