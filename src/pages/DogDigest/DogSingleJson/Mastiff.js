Then, carefully brush through the coat, making sure to get rid of any mats or tangles. Be careful not to brush too hard, as this can damage the coat and skin. Once the coat is brushed out, use a high-quality dog shampoo to wash the dog's body. Be sure to lather the shampoo up well and rinse it off completely. Finally, use a dog conditioner to help keep the coat healthy and shiny. Massage the conditioner into the coat and let it sit for a few minutes before rinsing it off.",
